### Alternatives

This site is not novel.

Top Google Search result for "uuid generate online":
[www.uuidgenerator.net/](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/) (this one works just
fine, and has support for generating a whole bunch of uuids at once)

Or do you have access to a unix command line? Depending on your distro, you may
have `uuidgen` which would be fewer keystrokes than opening up a website.
